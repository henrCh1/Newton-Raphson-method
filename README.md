# Newton-Raphson-method
这个程序使用Python编写，采用牛顿迭代法和弦截法求解非线性方程的根。相较于在大型计算中速度缓慢的二分法，牛顿法和弦截法能够提供更好的收敛和精度要求。牛顿法因其快速的收敛、高稳定性和高精度而广受欢迎。虽然弦截法避免了求导的过程，但其收敛速度略慢于牛顿法。不过相比牛顿法，弦截法可以省去求导的步骤。需要注意的是，弦截法只能得到初始值附近的一个根。通过调整相关参数和重新定义方程，可以以指定的精度求解所需的非线性方程。代码中有详细的注释，以帮助您更好地理解其内容。/
The program is written in Python and uses the Newton-Raphson method and the secant method to solve roots for nonlinear equations. Compared to the slow speed of the bisection method in large-scale calculations, the Newton and secant methods provide better convergence and precision requirements. The Newton method is popular for its fast convergence, high stability, and high precision. Although the secant method avoids the process of differentiation, its convergence rate is slightly slower than that of the Newton method. However, compared to the Newton method, the secant method can avoid the process of differentiating. It should be noted that the secant method can only obtain one root near the initial value. By adjusting relevant parameters and redefining equations, the required nonlinear equation can be solved with specified precision. The code contains detailed comments to help you better understand its content.
